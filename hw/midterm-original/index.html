				<p>
				Futurama is an animated television show, geared toward an adult audience, that ran nonconsecutively from 1999 to 2013. The show centers around the character of Philip J. Fry ("Fry"), a twenty-something pizza delivery boy living in New York City. The series opens on New Year's Eve 1999 when Fry falls into a cryogenic freezer, simultaneously setting its one-thousand year timer.
				</p>
				<p>
				Fry wakes up in the year 3000 in a comedically futuristic version of New York (now called "New New York"). He quickly meets the other main characters of the show and becomes employed at an intergalactic delivery service called Planet Express. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The episodes are generally self-contained stories centering around the exploits and experimental misadventures of the Planet Express crew, but there are a few story arcs that span several series' and focus mostly on the interpersonal and romantic relationships of the crew members.

				Dr. Zoidberg, a lobster-like alien serving as the Planet Express physician, who knows almost nothing about human anatomy; Professor Hubert Farnsworth, an eccentric old man who owns Planet Express and uses its profits solely to fund his bizarre science experiments; Hermes, a ganja-smoking beaurocrat with a deep love for meaningless paperwork; Philip J. Fry; Leela, an attractive cyclops, captain of the Planet Express ship and Fry's main love interest; Amy, a very girlie physics graduate student; and Bender, a robot, alcoholic, and notorious thief who is also Fry's best friend.

				<p>
				Futurama originally ran on the Fox network from 1999 to 2003. After making several changes to the day and time that the show would air, and even witholding a few episodes that didn't make it on air at all, Fox stopped commisioning new episodes and let the show go out of production during its fourth season. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In 2005, Comedy Central acquired syndication rights for Futurama, and in 2006, announced that four straight-to-DVD movies would be produced (which were later split up into 16 episodes and aired as a fifth season). Finally, in 2009, Comedy Central announced that it had officially picked up the show for a sixth season, and after even more uncertainty about the show, finally announced a seventh season in 2011. This is officially Futurama's final season.
				</p>
				<p>
				Because Futurama was constantly in a state of uncertainty about when the show would actually end, it has had four total episodes written to stand as the series finale: "The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings", "Into the Wild Green Yonder", "Overclockwise", and the actually finale, "Meanwhile".
