					<p>
						Futurama occasionally inspires fan-created content, the most well-known of which is almost certainly the "not sure if..." meme, which uses a still image of a squinting Fry (from the season two episode "The Lesser of Two Evils"), accompanied by text. The top line reads, "Not sure if <em>X</em>", and the bottom line, "Or just <em>Y</em>". Fry's skeptical expression in this scene serves the meme's intent; however, its text is unrelated to the show.

						The show's team, in a display of awesomeness, recognized the Fry meme during season seven at the end of an opening sequence:

						On other occasions, Futurama is a work of fanfiction in its own right. Despite Star Trek having been banned from Futurama's Earth by the year 3000 (it had became a full-fledged religion and was the cause of the <em>Star Trek Wars</em>), the team often pays homage to Star Trek throughout the series. Some of these hat-tips are subtle, like the use of recognizeable costume and set elements, as well as original 1960s Star Trek sound effects. Most infamously, the door-whooshing clip:

						Zapp Brannigan- a major supporting character who captains another ship- is a broad parody of James Kirk. Brannigan mimics Kirk's mannerisms and doubles his arrogance, but lacks most of his redeeming qualities.

						More bluntly, several Star Trek actors were invited to make recurring cameos. Guest-stars included William Shatner (<em>ST</em>: James Kirk), George Takei (<em>ST</em>: Mr. Sulu), Jonathan Frakes (<em>TNG</em>: William Riker), Leonard Nimoy (<em>ST</em>: Mr. Spock), Nichelle Nichols (<em>ST</em>: Uhura), and Walter Koenig (<em>ST</em>: Pavel Chekov), all of whom voiced a fictionized version of themselves.

					<h1 class="h1">The Futurama Theorem</h1>
					<p>
						Weirdly enough, at least once, Futurama has crossed-over into real life and ceased to be <em>just</em> fiction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several of the show's writers are scientists and mathematicians, including David X. Cohen (Bachelor's in physics from Harvard and Master's in theoretical computer science from Berkeley), Jeff Westbrook (PhD in computer science from Princeton), Sarah J. Greenwald (PhD in mathematics from the University of PA), and Ken Keeler (PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard). These writers contributed tons of physics and math-related humor to the show.
					</p>
					<p>
						Keeler went even further for the episode "The Prisoner of Benda". Its plot centers around the Professor's new invention, which allows two people to swap bodies. However, once any given pair has swapped, they are unable to swap again, and must therefore utilize additional people to return to their own bodies. At the episode's conclusion, everyone on the  Planet Express crew ends up in a different body, and must figure out how to return to their own.
					</p>
					<p>
						For this, Keeler wrote a new and complete mathematical theorem, which proves that regardless of how many switches between two bodies have been made, everyone can be restored using two additional people, assuming they haven't made any prior switches. Keeler's Futurama Theorem is the first created for the sole purpose of entertainment.
