    Hi boys. I'm Tina. Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random but
    they're my phone number. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at
    once? There's a lot of carrots in that stew. Drop the towel. The hand
    wants what the hand wants. This is such a snore-gasm. Everything I know to
    be true just went out the window. uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Dear God, this is Tina
    from school. You had me at horses, but then you lost me at corpses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my
    art class. I think her name is Kristi. If I were a hamburger you'd come and
    watch! Everyone began to touch each other's butts. I'm no hero. I just put
    my bra on one boob at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. My crotch is itchy.
    Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? If you need me, I'll
    be down here on the floor. Dying. I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark
    gets me. We can make this work. We can work out a dating wheel, just like a
    chore wheel. Let's put the try in triangle. Everything I know to be true
    just went out the window. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. I texted
    back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. Hey
    Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? This
    is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. There's someone behind the
    milk. Maybe it's the dairy fairy. Everyone touched each other's butts, and
    it was great. My bra's chafing me.
  </p>

  <p>
    She grabbed Jimmy Jr's butt and changed the world. uhhhhhhh YOU GORGEOUS
    IDIOT! If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are.
    Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random but they're my phone
    number. Everything I know to be true just went out the window. Suddenly,
    Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Sausage
    leather belts. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one
    free hand. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming,
    'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it.
