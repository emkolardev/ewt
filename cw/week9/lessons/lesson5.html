  <p>
    It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a
    kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's
    arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third
    antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched
    himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had
    come.
  </p>

  <p>
    Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's
    head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane,
    swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back. The man
    before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow
    in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made
    off down the lane after the chaise, with the sturdy man close behind him,
    and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he
    rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again. He
    would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very
    pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had a
    revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and her
    companion were attacked. She fired at six yards' distance, narrowly missing
    my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and his companion
    followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in sight down the
    lane, where the third man lay insensible.
